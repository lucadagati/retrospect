## üîß Core Components

### 1. Kubernetes Control Plane

The Kubernetes control plane serves as the central orchestration layer:

- **API Server**: Handles all API requests and provides the central interface
- **etcd**: Distributed key-value store for cluster state
- **Scheduler**: Determines where to place workloads
- **Controller Manager**: Runs controller processes

#### Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)

Wasmbed extends Kubernetes with custom resources:

```yaml
# Device CRD
apiVersion: wasmbed.github.io/v1alpha1
kind: Device
metadata:
  name: device-001
spec:
  device_type: "hifive1"
  capabilities: ["wasm", "tls"]
  public_key: "base64_encoded_public_key"
status:
  phase: "Connected"
  last_heartbeat: "2024-09-01T22:00:00Z"
```

```yaml
# Application CRD
apiVersion: wasmbed.github.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: my-wasm-app
spec:
  name: "My WASM Application"
  wasm_bytes: "base64_encoded_wasm_binary"
  target_devices:
    device_names: ["device-001"]
  config:
    memory_limit: 1048576
    cpu_time_limit: 1000
```

### 2. Application Controller

The Application Controller is a Kubernetes controller that manages the lifecycle of WASM applications:

#### Responsibilities
- **Reconciliation**: Continuously monitors Application CRDs and ensures desired state
- **Deployment**: Coordinates application deployment to target devices
- **Status Management**: Updates application status based on device feedback
- **Error Handling**: Implements retry logic and error recovery

#### Architecture
```rust
pub struct ApplicationController {
    client: Client,                    // Kubernetes client
    gateway_client: Arc<GatewayClient>, // Gateway communication
    app_status_cache: Arc<RwLock<BTreeMap<String, ApplicationStatus>>>,
    retry_config: RetryConfig,
}
```

#### Reconciliation Loop
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant K8S as Kubernetes API
    participant AC as Application Controller
    participant GW as Gateway
    participant MCU as MCU Device
    
    K8S->>AC: Watch Application CRD changes
    AC->>AC: Reconcile Application
    AC->>GW: Deploy Application
    GW->>MCU: Send WASM binary
    MCU->>GW: Application status
    GW->>AC: Status update
    AC->>K8S: Update Application status
```

### 3. Gateway MPU

The Gateway acts as a proxy between Kubernetes and MCU devices:

#### Components

**TLS Server**
- Handles secure communication with MCU devices
- Manages TLS handshakes and certificate validation
- Provides encrypted communication channels

**Device Management**
- Maintains device connections and heartbeats
- Tracks device status and capabilities
- Handles device enrollment and authentication

**Application Deployment**
- Distributes WASM applications to target devices
- Manages application lifecycle on devices
- Collects application status and metrics

#### Architecture
```rust
pub struct Gateway {
    tls_server: TlsServer,
    device_manager: DeviceManager,
    app_deployer: ApplicationDeployer,
    config: GatewayConfig,
}
```

### 4. MCU Firmware

The MCU firmware runs on RISC-V microcontrollers:

#### Components

**WASM Runtime**
- Executes WebAssembly applications
- Provides sandboxed execution environment
- Manages application lifecycle

**Network Stack**
- Handles TCP/TLS communication
- Implements the Wasmbed protocol
- Manages connection state

**Security Module**
- Handles TLS authentication
- Manages cryptographic operations
- Provides secure boot capabilities

    GW->>MCU: Send WASM Binary
    MCU->>GW: Application Status
    GW->>CONTROLLER: Status Update
    CONTROLLER->>K8S: Update Application Status
```

### 3. Heartbeat and Monitoring Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant MCU as MCU Device
    participant GW as Gateway
    participant K8S as Kubernetes
    
    loop Every 30 seconds
        MCU->>GW: Heartbeat Message
        GW->>GW: Update Device Status
        GW->>K8S: Update Device CRD Status
    end
```

## üîê Security Architecture

### 1. TLS Communication

All communication between components uses TLS 1.3:

- **Gateway ‚Üî MCU**: Mutual TLS authentication
- **Controller ‚Üî Gateway**: TLS for API communication
- **Controller ‚Üî Kubernetes**: TLS for API communication

### 2. Certificate Management

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Certificate Authority"
        CA[Wasmbed CA]

    end
    
    subgraph "Gateway"
        GW_CERT[Gateway Certificate]
        GW_KEY[Gateway Private Key]
    end
    
    subgraph "MCU Devices"
        MCU1_CERT[MCU 1 Certificate]
        MCU1_KEY[MCU 1 Private Key]
        MCU2_CERT[MCU 2 Certificate]
        MCU2_KEY[MCU 2 Private Key]
    end
    
    CA --> GW_CERT
