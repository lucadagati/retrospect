## Overview

Wasmbed is a comprehensive 3-layer architecture (cloud-fog-edge) designed to enable secure deployment and execution of WebAssembly applications on heterogeneous edge devices including MPU, MCU, and RISC-V systems. The platform provides real-time communication capabilities for industrial robotic applications, particularly PX4 autopilot integration.

### Key Features

- **Kubernetes Integration**: Custom CRDs and controllers for application lifecycle management
- **TLS Security**: Mutual authentication with custom TLS implementation
- **QEMU Emulation**: Realistic emulation of edge devices for development and testing
- **WebAssembly Runtime**: no_std compatible runtime for embedded systems
- **Real-time Communication**: microROS and FastDDS integration for PX4 systems
- **Device Management**: Secure enrollment and connection workflows

## Architecture

The platform follows a 3-layer architecture:
